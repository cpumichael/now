Simple 3 month calendar utility

A ripoff/reimplentation of a Perl utility by Tom Christiansen.  Tom's
impementation called the commandline cal program and then did the reverse
video on today.  This implementation in Python uses the standard library
calendar module instead of calling an external binary.  This utility works
with Python 2 and 3.

Prints a 3 month calendar with the current month centered and the current day in reverse video.
